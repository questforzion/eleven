          <p>
            Born in Nashville, TN to his mother, the former manager of “Take 6”,
            Gail Masondo, and his father, Duane Hamilton, a singer with the
            local group, “The Brothers Of Nashville”, Ziyon (born Jonathan
            Hamilton) developed a deep love for music at an early age. From the
            age of nine, he would join his mother in studio sessions and watch
            closely as songs were being crafted. This childhood experience
            helped to shape his musical journey and as a teenager he was already
            writing his own music and performing at various events in his home
            town.
          </p>
          <p>
            When he left high-school, he decided to pursue music full time. He
            was involved in an improv hip-hop band called “Audiofonix” during
            his early twenties and they played at various venues in Nashville,
            gaining experience and having fun.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2004 he decided to move to Johannesburg to be with his mother and
            her husband, producer/bassist Victor Masondo, and really began
            focusing on building his professional career. He enjoyed writing and
            producing for other artists and became very intrigued with the local
            deep house scene.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2006, Ziyon met dj/producer Ryzor, eventually forming the group,
            “Liquideep”. Four years later, in 2010, they would release their
            award winning album “Fabrics Of The Heart” and began touring the
            world. After four years together, in 2014, the group parted ways and
            Ziyon began his solo career, releasing his debut album, “Audio
            Alchemy”.
          </p>
          <p>
            Known for his soulful voice and thoughtful lyrics, he immediately
            gathered a loyal fan base around him. His style of music is not just
            limited to deep house but is also influenced by hip hop, soul,
            gospel and electronic music. This melodic mix creates a distinctive
            sound that intrigues and transports his listeners. He seems larger
            than life when performing his music, penetrating into hearts and
            souls of those who listen.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since the release of Ziyon’s current album, “ALGRTHMS”, his career
            has come a long way. With the heavy use of chopped up samples,
            driving rhythms and a solid low end, Ziyon fully showcases his
            ability to create an atmosphere through sound. During the 2020
            pandemic, he founded the record label, Nirvatone, and began
            releasing content via the imprint.
          </p>
          <p>
            Writing and recording his latest upcoming release has been a
            priority and Ziyon hopes to release it within the year. He says that
            this project is a culmination of many years of experience and offers
            a new atmosphere for listeners whilst retaining all the well-loved
            elements of his past releases.
